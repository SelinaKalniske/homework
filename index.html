            <li>Chicago River</li>
            <p>The Chicago River is the only river system in the world that flows in reverse. The river drains away from Lake Michigan, which provides drinking water to the city.

Access through the Illinois & Michigan Canal to the Des Plaines River and the Mississippi River system provided opportunities for trade and shipping throughout the Midwest.</p>
